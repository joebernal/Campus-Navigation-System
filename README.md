# üè´ Campus Navigation System üìç

A web-based navigation tool for a university campus that uses **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**, **DFS (Depth-First Search)**, and **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm** to compute paths between campus locations. The project features an interactive map (powered by **Leaflet.js**) and a data processing script (in **Python**) that converts GeoJSON data into a graph of nodes and edges.

## ‚ú® Features

1. **Interactive Map Interface**  
   - Users can view a campus map with clickable or selectable buildings and pathways.

2. **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms**  
   - **BFS:** Finds the path by exploring all nodes at each depth before moving deeper (shortest path in terms of number of edges on an unweighted graph).  
   - **DFS:** Explores as far as possible along each branch (not guaranteed shortest route).  
   - **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm:** Computes the shortest path based on distances (weighted edges), suitable for real distances on campus.

3. **Data Processing with Python**  
   - Converts campus GeoJSON data into a graph representation (`campus_nodes_edges.json`) including node coordinates, edges, and distances.

4. **Validation Checks**  
   - Ensures users select valid start/end locations and an algorithm before computing routes.  
   - Prevents identical start/end choices.

5. **Modular Codebase**  
   - **`algorithms.js`** for pathfinding logic.  
   - **`app.js`** for main application flow, map initialization, and UI event handling.  
   - **`process_geojson.py`** for data processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Front-End:**
  - **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript**
  - **Leaflet.js** for map visualization

- **Back-End / Data Processing:**
  - **Python 3** with a custom script (`process_geojson.py`) for generating graph data from GeoJSON

- **Algorithms:**
  - **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)
  - **DFS** (Depth-First Search)
  - **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm**

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/campus-navigation.git
   cd campus-navigation
   ```

2. **Serve the Application Locally:**  
   - You can use a local server (e.g., Python‚Äôs built-in server) to serve `index.html`:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Select Start and End Locations:**
   - Use the dropdown menus under **Start Location** and **End Location**.  
   - Ensure these are different (the app will show an error if they‚Äôre the same).

2. **Choose an Algorithm:**
   - **BFS**: Explores nodes in layers; good for unweighted graphs but ignores real distances.  
   - **DFS**: Explores a single path deeply; not guaranteed shortest.  
   - **Dijkstra‚Äôs**: Considers distances and finds the true shortest path on weighted graphs.

3. **Click **Find Route**:**
   - The app calculates the route using your chosen algorithm.  
   - A polyline is drawn on the map indicating the path.

## Future Enhancements

- **Display Path Statistics:**
  - Show total distance traveled and estimated walking time on the UI.
- **Accessibility Features:**
  - Indicate wheelchair-accessible routes or building entrances.
- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Handle temporary blockages or construction routes.
